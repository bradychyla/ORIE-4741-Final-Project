## Description
This project is on assessing the safety of driving in the United States. We are looking into helping people stay safe while driving, so we are evaluating the safety of specific car models based on the severity of injuries received on the types of accidents the cars are in as well as the frequency of accidents dependent on factors like location and time. Based on these, we can give recommendations for drivers on things they can do to be safer while driving, such as buying safer cars and avoiding behaviors and contexts that cause more accidents.
